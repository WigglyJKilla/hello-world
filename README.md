# hello-world

in the beginning...

Wiggly here! Just trying to learn a bit more about coding and the coding community. I've always wanted to make simple programs to make my life easier or to help others. I've often seen links to github and have tried to use it but didn't know exactly how it was structured.

This should be fun!
